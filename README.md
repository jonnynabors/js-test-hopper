# JavaScript Test Hopper

A lightweight extension for JavaScript/TypeScript projects that allow you to quickly navigate between a test file and its corresponding implementation file (and vice versa).

## Getting Started

- Install the exension from the VSCode Marketplace
- Open an implementation file, e.g. `main.ts` (or a test file, it doesn't really matter)
- Hop to the corresponding test file via `cmd + ctrl + t` for Mac or `alt + ctrl + t` for Windows
- Repeat as necessary :smiley:
